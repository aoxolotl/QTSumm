        "prediction": "the year of completion and the capacity for the churches listed in the table seem to have a strong correlation, as the years of completion generally correlate with the capacity of the auditoriums. for example, the glory dome in abuja, nigeria, which was completed in 2018, has a capacity of 100,000, making it the largest church auditorium in the world. on the other hand, the hand of god in port harcourt and the living faith church worldwide, both completed in 2020, have capacities of 90,000 and 50,000 respectively.",
        "reference": "Analyzing the data, it can be observed that there is a general trend of increasing capacity as the years progress. For instance, the Faith Dome in Crenshaw had a capacity of 10,145 and was completed in 1989. In contrast, the Glory Dome, the largest church auditorium in Nigeria, was completed in 2018 and has a capacity of 100,000. Although there are some exceptions to this trend - such as the Yoido Full Gospel Church completed in 1973 with a capacity of 12,000 - the general pattern indicates that larger church auditoriums have been built more recently. This correlation between the year of completion and increasing capacity suggests that churches have expanded their reach and congregation size over the years, simultaneously working to accommodate larger gatherings within their auditoriums."

Generally, there seems to be a trend of taller buildings being built in the late 20th century, with the top four tallest buildings in the city being constructed between 1914 and 1995. However, this trend is not consistent, as evidenced by Saint Michael's Church, which was constructed in 1890 and holds the 10th position in height. Overall, while there appears to be some correlation between the age of some buildings and their height, there are notable exceptions, and no clear, direct relationship can be established between the two factors."
