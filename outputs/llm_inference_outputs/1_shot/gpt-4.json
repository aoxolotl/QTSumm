The team with the lowest PAG, Wisconsin, finished 2nd in the conference and had an AP final rank of #7. On the other hand, the team with the highest PAG (Michigan, 23.4) ranks 8th in the conference and didn't make it into the AP final rank. However, there are some exceptions to this pattern. For example, Iowa had the highest AP final rank (#2) although they had a PAG of 14.6, which is not the lowest in the conference. Iowa disproves the correlation slightly as their PAG is much higher than Wisconsin's (8.6) but they still outperformed in the AP final rank. Ohio State, despite having a PAG relatively similar to Iowa (14.7), ranked lower at #8 AP final. It shows the correlation between AP final rank and PAG is not necessarily linear in this Conference season.",

This make think strong defense, not let many points scored against them, help them do good during the season. On the other hand, teams with big PAG scores, like Michigan and Minnesota, have low rankings in the meeting. This relationship show that stopping other teams from scoring help teams get better rankings in the 1958 Big Ten Conference football season."

A broad view suggests that more recent years of completion correlate with larger capacities, with some exceptions. For example, 'Glory Dome', completed in 2018, has a capacity of 100,000, the largest capacity in the list while 'The Hand of God' completed in 2020 has a slightly lower capacity of 90,000. However, 'Faith Tabernacle' church, completed in 1999, holds 50,000 which is higher than the 'International Gospel Centre' completed in 2000 with a capacity of 35,000. Conversely, 'Lakewood Church Central Campus', completed in 2005 holds only 16,000, which is much lesser than older churches like 'Faith Tabernacle'. Hence, while the trend seems to lean towards newer churches having larger capacities, there are considerable deviations.",
        "reference": "Analyzing the data, it can be observed that there is a general trend of increasing capacity as the years progress. For instance, the Faith Dome in Crenshaw had a capacity of 10,145 and was completed in 1989. In contrast, the Glory Dome, the largest church auditorium in Nigeria, was completed in 2018 and has a capacity of 100,000. Although there are some exceptions to this trend - such as the Yoido Full Gospel Church completed in 1973 with a capacity of 12,000 - the general pattern indicates that larger church auditoriums have been built more recently. This correlation between the year of completion and increasing capacity suggests that churches have expanded their reach and congregation size over the years, simultaneously working to accommodate larger gatherings within their auditoriums."

However, teams like Michigan and Illinois ranked lower despite having somewhat comparable records to the top-ranked teams.

This means teams with higher rankings usually do better in their all and conference records.

Also, teams with higher rankings often have better points each game (PPG) and smaller points allowed each game (PAG) than lower-ranking teams.

It's important to analyze the context of each film and the various factors contributing to their success or failure, rather than only looking at the release year.

It's also worth noticing that buildings with similar heights can have dramatically different ages, such as the Five Star Bank Plaza built in 1970 with a height of 284 feet being akin in height to the Clinton Square Building built twenty years later.
