Throughout this period, technology and equipment have also evolved, transitioning from bullhorn handlebars, oval steel tubing frames, and disc wheels to Graeme Obree \"superman-style\" handlebars, carbon monocoque aero frames, and 5-spoke front and rear disc wheels. This trend evidently demonstrates the significant impact of advancements in equipment, as well as the athletic endeavor of these record-breaking cyclists, allowing riders to cover greater distances with increased efficiency in less time."

In fact, the difference in age does not seem to have any noticeable impact on the record times, as all the riders were able to set their records within a 2-3 minute range.

The Helm Building and the Bank of Italy, which are ranked 8th and 9th respectively, both have 10 floors.

This suggests that while having more floors may contribute to a building",
        "reference": "The relation between number of floors and building height in tallest buildings in Fresno mostly positive. It means when floors more, building height also more. But this relation not always straight line because other things can affect building height, like each floor's height. For example, Golden State County Plaza has 21 floors but not tallest building in Fresno. It because its total height less than Robert E. Coyle United States Courthouse. This building only has 9 floors but higher total height."

While Eddie Firmani and J\u00falio Mazzei had relatively long tenures as coaches for the team, lasting for multiple years, the other coaches from non-United States countries had shorter stints. On the other hand, the coaches from the United States had shorter tenures, with only Gordon Bradley serving as coach for more than a year. This suggests that the team had more stability with coaches from non-United States countries, but the results may not have been as successful.",
        "reference": "In conclusion, the New York Cosmos had a diverse range of head coaches from both the United States and other countries between 1970 and 1985. This mix of nationalities brought different coaching styles, experience, and perspectives to the team, which might have contributed to the team's overall development and success. Both foreign and local coaches seemed to have an equal impact on the team, as evidenced by their multiple tenures and contributions to the team's performance. Ultimately, this mix of coaching backgrounds and nationalities likely served to enhance the team's growth and strengthen the New York Cosmos as a competitive force in American soccer."

For example, in 2004, the winner received a prize of $455,780 with 221 entries, while in 2019, the winner received a prize of $1,567,100 with 865 entries. This suggests that as more players participate in the event, the prize pool increases, and the winner receives a larger share of the prize money. However, it's important to note that there are also other factors that can influence the awarded prize, such as the skill level of the players and the luck of the draw.",

But when fewer entries, like 2004, 2017, 2018, prizes much less, it prove good relationship between number entries and winner prize."
