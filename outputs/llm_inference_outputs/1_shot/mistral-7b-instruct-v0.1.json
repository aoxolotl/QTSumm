Some churches, such as Glory Dome, The Hand of God, and Temple of Solomon, were completed recently in the 2010s and 2010s but are relatively small in comparison to newer churches such as Faith Tabernacle and International Gospel Centre. Similarly, Lakewood Church Central Campus, completed in 2005, is one of the largest churches in the world with a capacity of 16,000. Other churches, such as Deeper Life Bible Church and House of Hope, while also completed in the 2000s, have significantly lower capacities despite being relatively new. Overall, the relationship between the year of completion and the capacity of these churches is not straightforward and cannot be generalized.",
        "reference": "Analyzing the data, it can be observed that there is a general trend of increasing capacity as the years progress. For instance, the Faith Dome in Crenshaw had a capacity of 10,145 and was completed in 1989. In contrast, the Glory Dome, the largest church auditorium in Nigeria, was completed in 2018 and has a capacity of 100,000. Although there are some exceptions to this trend - such as the Yoido Full Gospel Church completed in 1973 with a capacity of 12,000 - the general pattern indicates that larger church auditoriums have been built more recently. This correlation between the year of completion and increasing capacity suggests that churches have expanded their reach and congregation size over the years, simultaneously working to accommodate larger gatherings within their auditoriums."

The closest correlation between construction and withdrawal is between locomotive number 88 and construction and withdrawal dates of July 1925 and March 1964, respectively, with only an eight-year gap between the two dates. This timeline suggests that the Robert Stephenson & Co's locomotives were built to serve a specific purpose within the railway system, and once their usefulness declined, they were withdrawn in a timely manner. This may indicate that the railway system had a well-planned strategy for replacement and maintenance of its locomotive fleet.",

However, he still lost out to Jonathan Duhamel, who only had two cashes but managed to win the tournament with $8,944,310 in earnings.

Besides, Michael Mizrachi has most cashes (23) and one earlier bracelet but he only in fifth place, so it seems no certain relation between cashes and last position is there.
