        "prediction": "Based on the timings recorded in the 4 x 100 meters relay races at the World Championships in Athletics for women from 1983 to 2015, it can be inferred that there has been a significant improvement in performance over the years. The fastest time recorded in the table is 41.29 seconds, set by Jamaica in 2013, which is more than a second faster than the next fastest time of 42.59 seconds set by West Germany in 1983. The trend suggests that there has been a steady improvement in performance each year, with the exception of a slight decline in the early 1990s. However, this decline is likely due to the absence of several top teams in the competition during that period, rather than a true deterioration in performance. Overall, the data suggests that the women's 4 x 100 meters relay race has become increasingly faster over the years, with Jamaica being the dominant team in the event in recent years.",

Similarly, in 2010, Jeremy Fant had a solid season with a 3-2 record and a 1.91 ERA, and the team won the League Championship. However, in 2013 and 2015, the team did not have a dominant pitcher, and their win-loss records were significantly worse. This suggests that",

However, Northwestern's conference record was slightly stronger than Michigan's, with the Wildcats winning two more games in Big Ten play. Overall, while both teams had successful seasons, Michigan's better overall record and conference record suggest that they were the stronger team during the 1940 Big Ten Conference football season.",
        "reference": "In 1940 Big Ten Conference football time, Northwestern is coached by Pappy Waldorf. Their overall record is 6-2 and conference record is 4-2. They are at third place in conference rankings. But Michigan do better, with their coach Fritz Crisler. They have overall record of 7-1 and conference record of 3-1. They get second position in conference. So, when compare two teams, Michigan have higher overall and conference win percent than Northwestern in 1940 season."

Additionally, Litjens failed to win or podium during the 2008 season, whereas he had achieved at least one win or podium finish in each of the previous three seasons.

Also, Litjens did not score any points all through his whole career, and his placement was recorded as NC (Not Classified) in every season.

Firstly, Johnson's playing time decreased significantly in 2011, with him being featured in only 12 games compared to the 12-12 games he played in the previous two seasons. This reduced playing time likely impacted his ability to rack up tackles and make significant plays, resulting in a decrease in his tackle numbers.\nSecondly, Johnson's tackle numbers for 2011 were also impacted by the increased opposition he faced. The table shows that Johnson faced opponents who averaged 32.5 rushing yards per game in 2011, which is significantly higher than the 14.5 rushing yards per game he faced in 2010. This increase in the difficulty of his opponents likely made it more challenging for Johnson to make tackles and rack up statistics.\nThirdly, Johnson's sack numbers also declined in 2011, despite him playing more games than in the previous season.

Of the top 4 finishers in the November Nine tournament in 2010, all of them had 5 or more prior WSOP cashes. In contrast, the players who finished in lower positions (8th or lower) had fewer than 5 prior cashes. This suggests that experience and familiarity with the WSOP circuit may be an advantage in the final stages of the tournament. However, it's important to note that there are many other factors that can influence a player's performance in a tournament, such as their skill level, luck, and strategic decisions, so this trend is not definitive and should be interpreted with caution.",

Besides, Michael Mizrachi has most cashes (23) and one earlier bracelet but he only in fifth place, so it seems no certain relation between cashes and last position is there.

Similarly, the top 5 highest-grossing films in the past 10 years are all from 2013 or later.
