Throughout this period, technology and equipment have also evolved, transitioning from bullhorn handlebars, oval steel tubing frames, and disc wheels to Graeme Obree \"superman-style\" handlebars, carbon monocoque aero frames, and 5-spoke front and rear disc wheels. This trend evidently demonstrates the significant impact of advancements in equipment, as well as the athletic endeavor of these record-breaking cyclists, allowing riders to cover greater distances with increased efficiency in less time."

However, there are exceptions like The Grand 1401 and the Tower at Convention Center Court, both having 11 floors but their height difference is significant - 173 feet and 160 feet respectively. Thus, in Fresno's tallest buildings, the height of the building does not directly correlate to the number of floors.",

But this relation not always straight line because other things can affect building height, like each floor's height. For example, Golden State County Plaza has 21 floors but not tallest building in Fresno. It because its total height less than Robert E. Coyle United States Courthouse.

It might be expected that newer churches would have larger capacities due to advancements in construction techniques, but the data does not strongly support this hypothesis. For instance, the 'Glory Dome' in Nigeria, completed in 2018, has the highest capacity at 100,000. Yet, 'The Hand of God', completed in 2020, has a slightly lower capacity at 90,000. Meanwhile, 'Faith Tabernacle', completed as far back as 1999, holds 50,000. The 'Yoido Full Gospel Church', completed in 1973, has a capacity of just 12,000. Therefore, there isn't a clear relationship between the year of completion and the capacity for the churches listed.",

For instance, the Faith Dome in Crenshaw had a capacity of 10,145 and was completed in 1989. In contrast, the Glory Dome, the largest church auditorium in Nigeria, was completed in 2018 and has a capacity of 100,000. Although there are some exceptions to this trend - such as the Yoido Full Gospel Church completed in 1973 with a capacity of 12,000 - the general pattern indicates that larger church auditoriums have been built more recently. This correlation between the year of completion and increasing capacity suggests that churches have expanded their reach and congregation size over the years, simultaneously working to accommodate larger gatherings within their auditoriums."

We can notice that old films like \"Shopner Thikana\" (1995) and \"Sotter Mrittu Nei\" (1996) have substantial earnings too. Moreover, even though recent films like \"Debi\" and \"Aynabaji\" released in 2018 and 2016 respectively, generated lower revenues, some of the joint ventures with India like \"Boss 2: Back to Rule\" and \"Shikari\" in more recent years managed to feature among the top grossers. Hence, the gross earnings do not show a decisive alignment with the year of release.",
        "reference": "There could be several factors affecting the variation in gross earnings, including changes in audience preferences, marketing strategies, distribution channels, production budgets, and the overall socio-economic context of the time. These factors can have a significant impact on the commercial success of films and often explain the changes in gross earnings over time.   It's important to analyze the context of each film and the various factors contributing to their success or failure, rather than only looking at the release year. As a result, the key to understanding the commercial success of Bangladeshi films might not be heavily correlated to their release year, but rather a combination of multiple factors influencing the industry."

However, there are exceptions. For example, in 2010, despite a significant number of entries (1,529), the prize, although high, was not the highest at $2,200,000. Conversely, in 2008 with 1,136 entries, the prize awarded was higher at $2,000,000. This suggests that while there's a general trend, the correlation doesn't strictly persist in all instances.\n",

The countries that performed first (Montenegro and Iceland) did not finish in top positions, ranking 15th and 8th respectively. While Russia, who performed in the 14th position, won the contest, Albania, which performed 5th, secured the 2nd position. Moreover, Austria, despite performing towards the end (16th), ended up last (18th). Therefore, it can be inferred that the performance order does not significantly influence the final ranking in this contest.",
