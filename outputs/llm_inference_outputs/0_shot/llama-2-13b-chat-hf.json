In contrast, the buildings constructed earlier in the 20th century, such as Buffalo City Hall and the Rand Building, are significantly shorter, with an average height of around 300-400 feet. This suggests that the height of tallest buildings in Upstate New York has increased over time, with more recent constructions reaching greater heights.",

        "prediction": "Based on the information provided in the table, there appears to be a positive correlation between the year of release and the gross earning of Bangladeshi films. The table shows that films released in recent years have generally had higher gross earnings than those released in earlier years. For example, the top three highest-grossing films - \"Dhaka Attack\" (2017), \"PoraMon 2\" (2018), and \"Debi\" (2018) - were all released in the past three years and have grossed over \u09f39.50 crore each. In contrast, films released in the 1980s and 1990s, such as \"Beder Meye Josna\" (1989), \"Shopner Thikana\" (1995), and \"Keyamot Theke Keyamot\" (1997), have grossed lower amounts, ranging from \u09f38.65 crore to \u09f310.50 crore. This suggests that the Bangladeshi film industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, with films released in more",
        "reference": "There could be several factors affecting the variation in gross earnings, including changes in audience preferences, marketing strategies, distribution channels, production budgets, and the overall socio-economic context of the time. These factors can have a significant impact on the commercial success of films and often explain the changes in gross earnings over time.   It's important to analyze the context of each film and the various factors contributing to their success or failure, rather than only looking at the release year. As a result, the key to understanding the commercial success of Bangladeshi films might not be heavily correlated to their release year, but rather a combination of multiple factors influencing the industry."
