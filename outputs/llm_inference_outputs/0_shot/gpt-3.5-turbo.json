Some of the largest evangelical church auditoriums, like the Glory Dome in Abuja, Nigeria, were completed in 2018 and have a capacity of 100,000 people. Similarly, The Hand of God in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, completed in 2020, can accommodate 90,000 people. On the other hand, there are older churches like the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, South Korea, completed in 1973, with a capacity of 12,000 people.

For instance, the Faith Dome in Crenshaw had a capacity of 10,145 and was completed in 1989. In contrast, the Glory Dome, the largest church auditorium in Nigeria, was completed in 2018 and has a capacity of 100,000. Although there are some exceptions to this trend - such as the Yoido Full Gospel Church completed in 1973 with a capacity of 12,000 - the general pattern indicates that larger church auditoriums have been built more recently. This correlation between the year of completion and increasing capacity suggests that churches have expanded their reach and congregation size over the years, simultaneously working to accommodate larger gatherings within their auditoriums."

On the other hand, Illinois has a balanced and solid overall performance, with a decent offense and defense.",

Similarly, Chris Corchiani, who played 124 games for NC State, had 1,038 assists. It is worth noting that players like Ed Cota, Jason Brickman, and Keith Jennings, who played 138 or more games, also have impressive assist numbers. Therefore, it can be concluded that the number of games played does have an impact on the number of assists made by players from different teams.",

Players play more games usually get more assists, like the table show. For example, Bobby Hurley from Duke has most games play, 140, and has most assists in career, 1,076. But player like Taurence Chisholm from Delaware, who play only 110 games, has less assists, 877."

It's important to analyze the context of each film and the various factors contributing to their success or failure, rather than only looking at the release year.
