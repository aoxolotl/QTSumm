This could result in differences in attendance levels, especially when the two teams are playing in different cities. Additionally, the date of the games could play a role, as some fans may have been more likely to attend games closer to the end of the series, when the outcome was more unclear.

In general, as the engine capacity and horse-power goes up, the fuel use also goes up, meaning lower fuel efficiency. For example, the Superb 4000 model has the highest engine capacity (4.0 L V8 OHV), horse-power (96) and the highest fuel use (24 L/100km). But, the Superb OHV and Superb 3000 models have almost the same engine capacity and horse-power, still the Superb 3000 model is a little less fuel efficient (18 L/100km) compared to the Superb OHV model (18 L/100km), which might be due to other factors like vehicle weight or air flow."

Teams that have a higher number of innings (Inns.) tend to have a better chance of winning the match. This is because a team with more innings has more opportunities to score runs and dismiss the opposing team, ultimately leading to a higher likelihood of winning. Conversely, teams with a lower number of innings may struggle to score enough runs to overcome the opposing team's lead, leading to a higher likelihood of losing. For example, in the matches listed in the table, England, who has the highest number of innings (Inns.), won 7 out of 10 matches, while teams with lower innings (Inns.) lost or tied their matches. Therefore, it is clear that having more innings (Inns.) gives a team a significant advantage in the match, and teams that manage to score more runs and dismiss the opposing team earlier in the match are more likely to emerge victorious.",

        "prediction": "Between 1970 and 1985, the New York Cosmos had ten head coaches from non-United States countries and eight from the United States. Of the foreign coaches, three served for more than two years, while only one of the American coaches stayed in the position for that long. The longest-tenured foreign coach was J\u00falio Mazzei of Brazil, who led the team for three seasons, followed by \u00d6zdenak and Weisweiler of Turkey and West Germany, respectively, who also served for two years. In contrast, all of the American coaches had shorter tenures, with the exception of Firmani, who stayed for two years. This suggests that the team may have had more success with foreign coaches, as they were able to bring in new ideas and perspectives to the team.",
        "reference": "In conclusion, the New York Cosmos had a diverse range of head coaches from both the United States and other countries between 1970 and 1985. This mix of nationalities brought different coaching styles, experience, and perspectives to the team, which might have contributed to the team's overall development and success. Both foreign and local coaches seemed to have an equal impact on the team, as evidenced by their multiple tenures and contributions to the team's performance. Ultimately, this mix of coaching backgrounds and nationalities likely served to enhance the team's growth and strengthen the New York Cosmos as a competitive force in American soccer."

Additionally, the top 3 finishers have earned a total of over $12 million in WSOP earnings, while the bottom 3 finishers have earned a total of around $2 million.

It's important to analyze the context of each film and the various factors contributing to their success or failure, rather than only looking at the release year.
