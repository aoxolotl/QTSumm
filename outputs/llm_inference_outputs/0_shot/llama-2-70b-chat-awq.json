The table shows that in 13 out of the 16 cases, the team that scored a century went on to win the match. The only exceptions were instances where the team batting second scored a century but still lost the match. For example, in the 2013 match between England and New Zealand, Jonathan Trott scored a century in the second innings, but England still lost the match. This suggests that scoring a century in the second innings may not always guarantee a win, especially if the opposing team has already scored a large total in their first innings. However, in general, scoring a century tended to increase a team's chances of winning, as seen in the majority of the cases in the table.",

Additionally, Matthew Jarvis, who finished eighth, had no WSOP cashes prior to the November Nine. This trend suggests that having multiple WSOP cashes may increase a player's chances of finishing in a higher position. However, it's worth noting that there are exceptions to this trend, such as John Dolan, who had five WSOP cashes but finished sixth, and Cuong Soi Nguyen, who had no WSOP cashes and finished ninth.",

Besides, Michael Mizrachi has most cashes (23) and one earlier bracelet but he only in fifth place, so it seems no certain relation between cashes and last position is there.

While some players have scored centuries with a relatively low number of balls played, such as Andrew Flintoff's 105* off 91 balls, others have required more balls to reach their century, such as Martin Guptill's 189* off 155 balls. Additionally, there are instances where players have scored centuries with a similar number of balls played but with varying results, such as Eoin Morgan's 103* and 107* both off 85 balls, with one resulting in a win and the other in a loss. Overall, it suggests that factors such as the player's skill, the opposition's bowling attack, and the team's strategy may play a more significant role in determining the final score than the number of balls played.",

As player face more balls, their final score also goes up. This positive relationship is normal, because more balls give player more chance to score. But, important to say that how fast score goes up is different for different players."
