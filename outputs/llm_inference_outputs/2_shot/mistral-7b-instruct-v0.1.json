The table notes that three of the victims, Robert Nairac, Bernie Nolan, and Seamus Wright, were abducted while traveling abroad in France and the Republic of Ireland. The fact that most of the disappearances were linked to a paramilitary group operating in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland may have made investigative efforts more difficult for law enforcement officials. The fact that some of the victims were detected as missing in other countries may have complicated the search and rescue efforts. Additionally, the fact that many of the disappearances took place in the rural areas of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland may have contributed to the difficulty in investigating and locating the victims. Overall, the locations of the disappearances and the lingering involvement of paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland's past have likely had a significant impact on investigative efforts.",

Many missing persons gone from North Ireland, mostly in Belfast and South Armagh, seem to suggest Republicans as main suspect group.

Although there are some exceptions to this trend - such as the Yoido Full Gospel Church completed in 1973 with a capacity of 12,000 - the general pattern indicates that larger church auditoriums have been built more recently.

Out of these coaches, four were from non-United States countries \u2013 three from Europe (England, Italy, West Germany) and one from South America (Brazil). These coaches were Gordon Bradley, Ken Furphy, Eddie Firmani, Hennes Weisweiler, and J\u00falio Mazzei. The other five coaches were all from the United States \u2013 three players-turned-coaches (Gordon Bradley, Ray Klivecka, and Ken Furphy) and two professional coaches (J\u00falio Mazzei and Hubert Birkenmeier).\nA closer analysis of the table shows that the non-United States coaches had a mixed performance during their tenure as head coaches of New York Cosmos. Gordon Bradley was the most successful non-American coach, leading the team to the NASL championship in 1972 and 1973. Ken Furphy, who is also a non-American, had a productive stint as the head coach, taking the team to the NASL championship in 1976",
        "reference": "In conclusion, the New York Cosmos had a diverse range of head coaches from both the United States and other countries between 1970 and 1985. This mix of nationalities brought different coaching styles, experience, and perspectives to the team, which might have contributed to the team's overall development and success. Both foreign and local coaches seemed to have an equal impact on the team, as evidenced by their multiple tenures and contributions to the team's performance. Ultimately, this mix of coaching backgrounds and nationalities likely served to enhance the team's growth and strengthen the New York Cosmos as a competitive force in American soccer."

        "reference": "There could be several factors affecting the variation in gross earnings, including changes in audience preferences, marketing strategies, distribution channels, production budgets, and the overall socio-economic context of the time. These factors can have a significant impact on the commercial success of films and often explain the changes in gross earnings over time.   It's important to analyze the context of each film and the various factors contributing to their success or failure, rather than only looking at the release year. As a result, the key to understanding the commercial success of Bangladeshi films might not be heavily correlated to their release year, but rather a combination of multiple factors influencing the industry."

Only in two matches (Bermuda vs. West Indies and India vs. England) did the team batting first win. The New Zealand vs. Sri Lanka match was a tie, where neither team could score a run at the end of the 20th over. The reason for this trend can be attributed to the higher run rates that the teams can achieve when they are batting second, as they can build upon the initial innings and take advantage of any mistakes made by the opposing team during their batting phase. Additionally, batting second also allows the team to have more time to analyze the opposition's bowling and makes it easier to adjust their strategies.",
