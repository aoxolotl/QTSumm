Based on the information provided, there appears to be a trend between the year of completion and the capacity of the churches. It can be observed that the churches that were completed more recently (i.e., 2010s and 2020s) tend to have larger capacities than those completed earlier (i.e., 2000s and 1990s).\nFor example, the Faith Tabernacle in Living Faith Church Worldwide, which was completed in 1999, has a capacity of 50,000. In contrast, the National Temple in The Apostolic Church Nigeria, which was completed in 2011, has a capacity of 40,000.

In contrast, the Glory Dome, the largest church auditorium in Nigeria, was completed in 2018 and has a capacity of 100,000. Although there are some exceptions to this trend - such as the Yoido Full Gospel Church completed in 1973 with a capacity of 12,000 - the general pattern indicates that larger church auditoriums have been built more recently. This correlation between the year of completion and increasing capacity suggests that churches have expanded their reach and congregation size over the years, simultaneously working to accommodate larger gatherings within their auditoriums."

In contrast, the other two races (2004 and 2018) were won by riders from different countries than the stage start point.\nSo, while the data is limited to only five races, it suggests that there may be a pattern where riders from the same country as the stage start point have a higher chance of winning the race, especially when the distance of the race is shorter.

Of the teams ranked in the top 4 in the conference, all had better overall records than their rankings would suggest, with Wisconsin and Ohio State having better conference records than their AP final rankings. In contrast, Minnesota and Indiana, ranked 5th and 9th respectively, had worse overall and conference records than their rankings would indicate. This could suggest that team rankings are influenced by factors beyond just record, such as strength of schedule or preseason expectations.",
        "reference": "The connection between teams' rankings and their all and conference records looks to be positive related. This means teams with higher rankings usually do better in their all and conference records. Teams that have higher rank, like Wisconsin and Purdue, have more good all records and conference records compare to teams with lower rank, like Indiana. Also, teams with higher rankings often have better points each game (PPG) and smaller points allowed each game (PAG) than lower-ranking teams. This tells that how the teams do in matches and their power to win games affect their all ranking straight, with better doing teams getting higher rankings."

Plucky Hero - Castledown Lad - Lucky Rattle (bred by Wilf France, trainer from Haringay)\nFrom their finishes in the race, we can infer that Fred Farey's breeding technique resulted in a greyhound with a strong early speed, as Mondays News was able to grab the early lead and hold it until the finish. R Jones' breeding technique may have emphasized endurance, as Lilac Luck was able to maintain a strong pace throughout the race despite being considered a longer shot. Wilf France's breeding technique seems to have produced a versatile greyhound that can both run an early fast time and maintain a strong pace over the final stages of the race, as Plucky Hero finished",

In contrast, the shorter buildings, such as Patang Hotel and Shapath 5, have fewer floors (19 and 19, respectively).\nFurthermore, there seems to be a correlation between the height of a building and the number of floors it has. On average, the buildings in the table that are over 62 meters tall (203 ft) have around 20 floors, while those that are under 62 meters tall have around 15 floors. This suggests that taller buildings tend to have more floors to accommodate more office or residential space.\nHowever, it is worth noting that there are some exceptions to this trend. For example,IDS Galaxy and Y galaxy have a height of 70 meters",
        "reference": "According the data provided, in Ahmedabad the tall buildings number of floors generally related to their height. High number of floors building usually have more height in meters, we can see from top two building on list, GIFT One and GIFT Two, they have 29 floors and 122 meters tall. But there are some exceptions in list, like Mondeal Heights A and B, they are 70 meters tall only have 18 floors, this mean might be different height for single floor in different building."

The films released in the late 1990s and early 2000s have earned the highest gross revenue, with Beder Meye Josna (1989) and Shopner Thikana (1995) being the highest-grossing films of all time. The average gross earning per year decreases as we move further ahead in time, with the most recent films (released in 2018 and 2019) earning the lowest gross revenue. This may be due to a variety of factors, such as changes in audience preferences, increased competition from Bollywood and Hollywood films, and the lack of investment in the Bangladeshi film industry.",
        "reference": "There could be several factors affecting the variation in gross earnings, including changes in audience preferences, marketing strategies, distribution channels, production budgets, and the overall socio-economic context of the time. These factors can have a significant impact on the commercial success of films and often explain the changes in gross earnings over time.   It's important to analyze the context of each film and the various factors contributing to their success or failure, rather than only looking at the release year. As a result, the key to understanding the commercial success of Bangladeshi films might not be heavily correlated to their release year, but rather a combination of multiple factors influencing the industry."
