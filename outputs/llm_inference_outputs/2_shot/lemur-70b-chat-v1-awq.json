The IBU value for a beer is a measure of the bitterness of the beer. The level of bitterness in a beer is influenced by the amount and type of hops used in the brewing process. As a result, IBU values tend to be higher for beers that are characterized as being hoppy, while beers with a lower IBU value tend to be malt-forward or have a more balanced hop profile. Therefore, it is not surprising that an India Pale Ale (IPA) like the Red's Rye IPA has a high IBU value, as IPAs are known for their hoppy flavor and high bitterness. Conversely, a lager like Solid Gold is known for its crisp, clean flavor and thus it is not surprising that it has a low IBU value.\u00e9m\u4e3b\u304d\u3057\u3087\u3046\u90e8\u5206.",
        "reference": "Devil Dancer, a American Imperial IPA, have highest International Bitterness Unit (IBU) at 112, while Rubaeus, a Fruit beer, have lowest IBU at 15. These number show the bitter profile of their beer style. Devil Dancer have much high intense hop bitter like American Imperial IPAs usually have, and Rubaeus have much low bitter level because Fruit beer often focus on sweet and fruity taste."

Coyle United States Courthouse, which is also the building with the most floors (9). Similarly, the Fresno Pacific Towers and the Golden State County Plaza are both among the tallest buildings, and both have a comparatively large number of floors (15 and 21, respectively). However, this trend is not universal, as there are also examples of buildings with fewer floors and greater height, such as the Tower Convention Center Court, which is comparatively taller than the Hotel Californian but has fewer floors. To determine the extent of this relationship between number of floors and building height would require further numerical analysis of the data.ventionalsan analysis of the data in the table, it can be observed that there is a general positive correlation between the number of floors and the height of a building in Fresno'",

For instance, John Racener came in second and had 10 WSOP cashes, while Joseph Cheong came in third with just two. Similarly, John Dolan, who finished 6th, had five WSOP cashes, and Jason Senti, who came in 7th place, had only one. There may be some correlation between the final position and the number of WSOP earnings, as the top three earners all had more than $100,000 in cashes, but this does not always hold true. Finally, the starting chip count and prize money for each finalist also appear to be significant factors in determining their final position.",
        "reference": "According to the table information, no obvious trend between number of WSOP cashes and final position in November Nine - 2010 can be found. Example, John Racener has second most cashes (10) and he got second place, but Cuong Soi Nguyen has zero cashes still finished in ninth place. Besides, Michael Mizrachi has most cashes (23) and one earlier bracelet but he only in fifth place, so it seems no certain relation between cashes and last position is there. So from this, we can conclude that maybe having more WSOP cashes is not meaning doing better or higher rank in this event."
