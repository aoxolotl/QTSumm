Meanwhile, teams towards the bottom of the AP final ranks - Minnesota and Michigan State \u2013 tended to have higher PAG, at 17.4 and 13.7 respectively. This suggests that efficiency in defense, as indicated by a low PAG, could have been a critical factor in achieving a better AP final ranking.\n",
        "reference": "In the 1958 Big Ten Conference football time, it look like two connection between teams' AP final rank and PAG (Points Against Per Game) places. Top four rank teams - Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio State, and Purdue - all have small PAG scores compare to teams with not so good rankings. This make think strong defense, not let many points scored against them, help them do good during the season. On the other hand, teams with big PAG scores, like Michigan and Minnesota, have low rankings in the meeting. This relationship show that stopping other teams from scoring help teams get better rankings in the 1958 Big Ten Conference football season."

On the other hand, the 'Rubaeus', a fruit beer from Founders Brewing Company, has the lowest IBU of 15. This is consistent with the nature of fruit beers that are customarily less bitter and have a sweeter profile due to the addition of fruit flavors.",

In contrast, the Glory Dome, the largest church auditorium in Nigeria, was completed in 2018 and has a capacity of 100,000. Although there are some exceptions to this trend - such as the Yoido Full Gospel Church completed in 1973 with a capacity of 12,000 - the general pattern indicates that larger church auditoriums have been built more recently. This correlation between the year of completion and increasing capacity suggests that churches have expanded their reach and congregation size over the years, simultaneously working to accommodate larger gatherings within their auditoriums."
